Sony P-TTL Flash implementation on STC8 (8051) serial MCU. (currently manual flashing is not supported)

- INT0/INT1 and its ISR, with highest priority
- Timer 0 and its ISR, with priority 2
- a bidirectional IO port
- a register bank, defaultly 3

It must use INT0/1 (P32/P33) for both rising/falling edge supported ext-interruption for FLASH_F3CLK and FLASH_F1SYNC, since the other pins normally does not support both edge ext-interruption.
FLASH_F3CLK should be connected to pin 18 of Sony MI port.
Defaultly, FLASH_F1SYNC uses INT1(P33) and FLASH_F3CLK uses INT0(P32), define FLASH_F1SYNC and FLASH_F3CLK before this file to change this.
